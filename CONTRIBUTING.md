## 🌍 Translating Champions Lab

We're actively expanding language support. If you'd like to help translate Champions Lab into your language, here's how:

### Translation Files

All translation files are in `src/lib/i18n/`:

```
src/lib/i18n/
├── en.json                      # English (base language)
├── fr.json                      # French
├── abilities.fr.json            # Pokémon abilities (French)
├── items.fr.json                # Items (French)
├── moves.fr.json                # Moves (French)
├── natures.fr.json              # Natures (French)
├── pokemon-names.fr.json        # Pokémon names (French)
├── ability-descriptions.*.json  # Ability descriptions
├── item-descriptions.*.json     # Item descriptions
└── move-descriptions.*.json     # Move descriptions
```

### Adding a New Language

1. **Fork** the [repository](https://github.com/Andrew21P/ChampionsLab)
2. **Copy** the English translation file as a template:
   - `src/lib/i18n/en.json` → `src/lib/i18n/{lang}.json`
   - `src/lib/i18n/pokemon-names.fr.json` → `src/lib/i18n/pokemon-names.{lang}.json`
   - `src/lib/i18n/abilities.fr.json` → `src/lib/i18n/abilities.{lang}.json`
   - `src/lib/i18n/items.fr.json` → `src/lib/i18n/items.{lang}.json`
   - `src/lib/i18n/moves.fr.json` → `src/lib/i18n/moves.{lang}.json`
   - `src/lib/i18n/natures.fr.json` → `src/lib/i18n/natures.{lang}.json`
   - `src/lib/i18n/ability-descriptions.en.json` → `src/lib/i18n/ability-descriptions.{lang}.json`
   - `src/lib/i18n/item-descriptions.en.json` → `src/lib/i18n/item-descriptions.{lang}.json`
   - `src/lib/i18n/move-descriptions.en.json` → `src/lib/i18n/move-descriptions.{lang}.json`
   - (where `{lang}` is your language code, e.g., `es`, `de`, `ja`, `it`)
3. **Translate** all the keys and values to your language
4. **Update** `src/lib/i18n/index.tsx` to add your language to the language selector
5. **Commit** and **Push** your changes
6. **Open a Pull Request** with your language translation

### Updating an Existing Translation

If you want to improve or complete an existing translation:

1. **Fork** the [repository](https://github.com/Andrew21P/ChampionsLab)
2. **Edit** the translation file you want to improve:
   - Check `src/lib/i18n/{lang}.json` for missing keys or outdated strings
   - Update `src/lib/i18n/pokemon-names.{lang}.json`, moves, abilities, items, etc. as needed
   - Compare against the English version to ensure all keys are translated
3. **Test** your changes locally to ensure text displays correctly
4. **Commit** your changes with clear messages (e.g., "Update French translation: add missing meta keys")
5. **Push** to your fork and **open a Pull Request**

**Tips for updating:**
- Look for `❌` markers in comments or check if recent English updates haven't been translated yet
- Test on the actual website if possible to catch text overflow issues
- If you're making a partial update, mention what you've improved in the PR description

### Translation Guidelines

- Keep the same **JSON structure** as the English version
- Preserve **variable placeholders** like `{count}`, `{value}`, `{name}` — these are replaced at runtime
- **Don't translate** Pokémon names unless they have an official regional translation
- Use **professional terminology** for battle/competitive terms (Fake Out, Trick Room, etc.)
- Test your translation locally if possible — ensure text fits in UI elements
- If you're unsure about a term, leave a comment in the PR

### Example

**en.json:**
```json
{
  "meta": {
    "wrAbbr": "WR",
    "title": "Meta Analysis",
    "pokemonRanking": "Pokémon Ranking for {season}"
  }
}
```

**es.json (Spanish):**
```json
{
  "meta": {
    "wrAbbr": "TV",
    "title": "Análisis Meta",
    "pokemonRanking": "Clasificación de Pokémon para {season}"
  }
}
```
